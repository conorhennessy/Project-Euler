Project Euler Solutions
=======================

A collection of Conor Hennessy's code for solutions to Project Euler maths problems. I started this repo after completing a number of these challenges as a way of improving my programming skills and I hope to continue to solve and contribute my solutions to this repo for the foreseeable future.

Each solved problem solution is written in Python where I hope to also solve the problems in Java in the near future.
Comments can be found within solutions to provide mathematical explanation and to explain how the code works in general. Further comments may detail benchmark timings, time & space complexity or added efficiency/edge cases note.   
In some cases, old versions of code remain commented out to allow for direct comparison rather than making commit comparisons. To see improvement and algorithm changes.

I have optimised my code for human readability and acceptable run time, rather than a code-golf approach or trying to shave milliseconds off while making the code comparably less readable.
However, I do try to write code which is the most efficient and runs as quickly as possible.

### What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
